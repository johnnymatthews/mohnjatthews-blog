title: "Backdoors don't work"
description: "The cybersecurity situation in North American is becoming more and more dire as leaders fail to understand the basics of infosec, and as external threats continue to abuse this misunderstanding. One common knowledge-gap held by North American leaders is _\" why can't we build a secure backdoor that only we can use, but the bad guys can't?/"_."

<!--Explain what backdoors are.-->

A _backdoor_ refers to any method that bypasses normal authentication or security controls to gain access to a computer system, network, or app. It's like a secret entrance that lets someone get into an area while avoiding the normal security _front door_. Backdoors can be created in a few different ways:

1. Deliberately installed by developers for maintenance or troubleshooting. While this is **super bad** security practice, it's fairly common since it makes the developer's job way easier.
1. Maliciously inserted by attackers who have already compromised a system. This often happens by hackers compromising developer machines and/or workflows.
1. Created through vulnerabilities in software or hardware, often through a supply-chain attack.

These types of backdoor are particularly prickly, and can be hard to remove or even spot. But the type of backdoor we're going to discuss in the rest of this post is one that is **covertly installed by developers of a product or service at the behest of law enforcement**.
